ISL77 - Parallel Programming Lab

Part A: OpenMP Programs
1. Write a program to sort an array on n elements using both sequential and parallel merge sort(using Section). Record the difference in execution time.

2.	Estimate the value of pi using:
        pi = summation(k from 0 to infinity)((-1)^k / (2k + 1))
    Parallelize the code by removing loop carried dependency and record both serial and parallel execution times.

3.	Write an OpenMP program that divides the Iterations into chunks containing 2 iterations, respectively (OMP_SCHEDULE=static,2). Its input should be the number of iterations, and its output should be which iterations of a parallelized for loop are executed by which thread. For example, if there are two threads and four iterations, the output might be the following:
	Thread 0 : Iterations 0 −− 1
	Thread 1 : Iterations 2 −− 3
4.	Write a program to calculate n Fibonacci numbers using Parallel Directive. Demonstrate elimination of the race condition using Schedule directive.

5.	Write a program to find the prime numbers from 1 to n employing parallel for directive. Record both serial and parallel execution times.

6.	Parallel Vector Addition
7.	Write a program   calculate the sum of first 100 Numbers. (Using critical directive)
Part B: MPI programs
1.	Write a MPI program to implement Blocking send and receive functions.
2.	Write a MPI program to demonstrate deadlock and implement a solution to avoid deadlock
3.	Write a MPI program to implement Vector Addition of two vectors to generate resultant vector using Scatter and gather operation.
4.	Write a MPI program to find factorial of a number using Broadcast and Reduce operation.
5.	Write a MPI program to generate all prime numbers till ‘n’ (n being user input).
